Spam Mail Prediction using Machine Learning

#This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam using Logistic Regression. It leverages popular Python libraries for data processing, feature extraction, and model building
Key Features:

1.Preprocessing of raw email text (removing stopwords, lowercasing, etc.)

2.Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorization

3.Binary classification using Logistic Regression

4.Evaluation of model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Technologies Used:
1.Python

2.Pandas for data handling

3.NumPy for numerical operations

4.scikit-learn for vectorization, model building, and evaluation

5.TfidfVectorizer for converting text data into numerical feature vectors

6.Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional) for visualizations

How It Works:

Load Dataset – Load the dataset containing labeled email messages.

Text Preprocessing – Clean and prepare the data (removing stopwords, punctuation, etc.).

Feature Extraction – Convert text to numerical features using TF-IDF.

Train Model – Use Logistic Regression to train on feature vectors.

Model Evaluation – Test accuracy and other metrics to measure performance.

Prediction – Classify new email data as spam or not spam.
